### Development Setup

#### Using Laravel Sail in UNIX-like shells

**:warning: You must have docker installed in your system for this to work**

```bash
# clone the repository and cd into it
git clone git@github.com:marcos-aparicio/tasktango.git
cd tasktango
# copy .env.example to .env, make sure to check the port numbers that will be used
# so there isn't any problems with software you already have, particularly the APP_PORT and DB_PORT
cp .env.example .env
# install the dependencies
composer install
# start the containers
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
# create the application key
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
# install frontend dependencies
./vendor/bin/sail npm i
# compile frontend assets
./vendor/bin/sail npm run build # in case you are developing, you can use npm run dev instead
# apply database migrations
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
# link storage to public
./vendor/bin/sail artisan storage:link
# now you should be able to go to localhost in your browser, or localhost:<port> if you change the default port
```

### Aclarations

1. If you want Google Oauth to work in your environment you must first create the neccesary API credentials for that. This [tutorial](https://fajarwz.com/blog/create-login-with-google-oauth-using-laravel-socialite/#configuration) should help you.

2. If you find a bug, have a question or suggestion feel free to drop an issue in this repo.
